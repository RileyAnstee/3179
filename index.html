        <p>GENERAL WINE INDUSTRY STATISTICS
          There were 24.85 billion liters of wine sold worldwide in 2020.
          This was lower than the 27.47 billion liters sold in 2019, but the volume sold is expected to increase to
          26.59 billion liters in 2022 and continue to increase.
          The average wine consumption per U.S. resident in 2020 was 3.09 gallons.
          The U.S. consumed enough wine in 2020 for every resident to drink over three gallons.
          This number was up from 2019, when the average wine consumption per resident was 2.91 gallons. The overall
          average wine consumption per resident had increased by 33% from 2005, when it was at 2.33 gallons per
          resident.
          The COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns likely fueled the increase in wine consumption in 2020.
          Worldwide wine consumption in 2020 was about 234 million hectoliters.
          This is lower than the 2019 number of 241 million hectoliters. (There are 100 liters in a hectoliter.) The
          U.S. is the largest consumer of wine, drinking 33 million hectoliters in 2020, but France is close behind,
          consuming 24.7 million hectoliters that same year.</p>
